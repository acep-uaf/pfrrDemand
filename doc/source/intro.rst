The project `demand_acep`_
aims to make sense of the data collected by power meters at some facilities at the
`Poker Flat Research Range`_ (PFRR) managed by `Alaska Center of Energy and Power`_ (ACEP).
The project resulted in an open-source Python 3 package, that implements a data pipeline for high
resolution power meter data to easy access to data for data analytics and research.
The quick overview of the data pipeline can be seen below:
