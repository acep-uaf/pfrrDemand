About the power meters
======================

The data consists of 4 power meters. Three power meters are `WattsOnMk2`_ and one
meter is `PQube`_. The meter names and corresponding types are listed in `meter_names.txt`_
Each meter measures around 50 channels at a sub-second resolution. The channel names
and description can be found in `this file`_. These files will have to updated if there are any
changes to meter names or channels, like if more meters are added or more channels are being recorded.
